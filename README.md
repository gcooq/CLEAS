# CLEAS
the source codes of 'Efficient Architecture Search for Continual Learning'

# Environment
* python = 2.7
* Tensorflow 1.8

# Dataset
We use the publicly common datasets to verify the performance of our CLEAS, i.e., CIFIR-100 and two variants of MNIST.
* http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

# Usage
*  python CLEAS.py for MNIST
*  python CLEAS_CNN.py for CIFIR

# Notes
* Note that we also provide the CLEAS-C which can provide more accurate model design for CNN.

# Reference
Hope such an implementation could help you on your projects. Any comments and feedback are appreciated.
